# SSC_Trials_Analysis
## Background

Pymaceuticals Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals, recently began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).  SCC is a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

Analysis was done on the complete data from the most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated with a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. 


## Observations and Insights

1. While Capomulin appears to the focus of the company, Ramicane may also be worth looking into based on the box and whisker chart and the summary statistics. The mean tumor size on both of these drugs is very close and lower than the others. They also show the same standard deviation indicating that they are very close statistically.

2. The focus on much of the analysis was on average tumor volume or volume at the end. It would be good to get a picture of the change in tumor volume as that would take into account any anomolies in size at the beginning of the trial.

3. The tumor volume and weight had a strong correlation. You could assume that this is because larger tumors weigh more and thus cause the mice to weigh more. It could also indicate that the heavier mice do not respond as well to the Capomulin (since that was the drug analyzed for that scatter plot). More analysis by looking at the line plots of tumor volume on the heavier mice would be necessary to rule this out.
